<p>In this study, you will play a card game, and your goal is to win as many points as you can.</p>
<p>If your score lands you in the top ${percentile}% of participants, you will get an extra $${bonus} bonus, so please do your best!</p>

<p>The card game is very simple: on each turn you will choose one of the three decks below, so you can draw a card from it.</p>
<p>You can choose a deck using the <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, or <i>3</i> keys on your keyboard to choose the <i>left</i>, <i>middle</i>, or <i>right</i> deck respectively.</p>
<p>Let's practice choosing decks.</p>
<p>Please choose the <strong>left</strong> deck by pressing the <strong>1</strong> key.
<div class='image-container'>
    <img class='stimuli-left' src='${stim[0]}'>
    <img class='stimuli-middle' src='${stim[1]}'>
    <img class='stimuli-right' src='${stim[2]}'>
</div>`;

const english3 = `
<p>Great! Now choose the <strong>middle</strong> deck by pressing the <strong>2</strong> key.</p>
<div class='image-container'>
    <img class='stimuli-left' src='${stim[0]}'>
    <img class='stimuli-middle' src='${stim[1]}'>
    <img class='stimuli-right' src='${stim[2]}'>
</div>`;

const english4 = `
<p>Excellent! Now choose the <strong>right</strong> deck by pressing the <strong>3</strong> key.</p>
<div class='image-container'>
    <img class='stimuli-left' src='${stim[0]}'>
    <img class='stimuli-middle' src='${stim[1]}'>

<p>Good job! You have successfully practiced selecting decks.</p>
<p>After you select a deck, the top card will turn over.</p>
<p>This card can either win you an additional 100 points ('winning' cards) or take away 50 points ('losing' cards).</p>
<p>Below you can see what those cards look like:</p>
<div class='outcome-container'>
    <img class='outcome-left' src='stim/outcome/scaled_win.jpg'>
    <img class='outcome-right' src='stim/outcome/scaled_lose.jpg'>
</div>
<p><strong>Note that each deck contains both winning and losing cards, but in different amounts.</strong></p>
<p>Your job is to figure out which deck is the best deck, so that you can get as many points as possible.</p>
Please press the zero (0) key to continue.`;

const english6 = `
<p>However, there is one final catch:</p>
<p><b>There may be times when the best deck will change!</b></p>
<p>If you think the best deck has changed from what it was before, then try to find out the new best deck.</p>
<br />
<p>The following is a practice round of just 3 turns.<p>
<p>The points you get here wonâ€™t change your final score, and the best deck will change between the practice round and when the real game starts.</p>
<br /><br />
Please press the zero (0) key to start the practice round.`;

const english7 = `
<p>You have now completed the practice round.</p>
<p>The main task will take approximately another 10 minutes, with longer individual rounds than the practice.</p>
<p>Please press the zero (0) key whenever you are ready to start the main task.</p>`;
